Prove by induction that there is a unique path between any pair of vertices in a tree.



Inducting On : The *edge* height of a tree.

Hypothesis : For every node in the tree there is a unique path between any two nodes.

Base Case : Consider a tree of height 1 (edge height). This tree has a single root node and $k$ children nodes.  By the definition of a tree there is a unique edge for every child and parent. Consider two cases, either a pair of nodes is between the root node and and a child, or it is between two children.  In the first case the uniqueness of the path comes right from the tree definition.  In the second case a unique path between sibling nodes must go through the root. And since there there is a unique edge between a child and the root, and a path between two children is the combination of these, every pair of sibling nodes must have a uniqe path.

Induction Step : Given a tree $T_n$ were every two nodes have a unique path, we wish to show a tree $T_{n+1}$ has the same property. Since the path between nodes in $T_n$ are already guaranteed to be unique by the induction hypothesis, we are only concerned with paths involving the newly added leaf nodes of $T_{n+1}$.  For a pair of nodes $(n_i, n_j)$, one of which is a new leaf node of $T_{n+1}$, consider the following cases.  Case 1, the pair consists of a node in $T_n$ and a leaf node.  Case 2 both nodes are leaf nodes.  We wish to show that for both cases the invariance holds.  Case 1, suppose $n_i$ is the leaf node and $n_j$ the node in $T_n$. The path for the pair $(parent (n_i), n_j)$ is guaranteed to be unique.  Since this path is unique and adding an child edge to this path which is guarenteed to be unique by the one edge per child property of trees, the path between $(n_i, n_j)$ must then be unique.  Case 2, consider the path between $(parent (n_i), parent(n_j))$.  This path must be unique by the induction hypothesis. Again since every edge between a parent and a child is unique in trees, adding the edge between $(n_i, parent (n_i))$ and $(n_j, parent (n_j))$ must be unique to $n_i$ and $n_j$ respectively.  Thus $T_{n+1}$ has a unique path between any two nodes.

Prove that in breadth first search on a undirected graph $G$ every edge is either a tree or a cross edge, where $x$ is neither an ancestor nor descendant of $y$, in cross edge $(x, y)$.

Consider a breadth first search on a graph $G$ starting at a node $g_r$.


<!-- On an undirected graph, backwards edges (forward edges) with respect to $g_r$ cannot exist in a breadth first search.  This can be seen by considering the fact that in a breadth first search we evalute edges with distance $d_1$ to $g_r$ before edges of greater distance $d_2 > d_1$.  For an undirected graph finding a backward(forward) edge would be contradiction, as the distance between a backward(forward) edge and $g_r$ would be less than the distance between $g_r$ and the edge that discovered the backward(forward) edge, contradicting the distance property of BHS. -->

**Lemma**

In a breadth first search we evalute edges with distance $d_1$ to $g_r$ before edges of greater distance $d_2 > d_1$.  For an undirected graph finding a node $n$ with an edge distance shorter than the its parent search node $n_r$ would be contradiction, as the distance between a $n$ and $g_r$ would be less than the distance between $n_r$ and $g_r$. This contradicts the distance property of BHS.

**Induction**

Inducting On : A step of breadth first search.  Where a step is the evaluation all the nodes of edge distance $d$ away from $g_r$.

Induction Hypothesis : Every edge is a tree edge or a cross edge $(x, y)$ such that $x$ is neither an ancestor nor descendant of $y$, in cross edge $(x, y)$

Base case : The first evalution of connected nodes of $G_r$.  Since we every node were are evaluting is a direct descedant of $G_r$, every node must be a tree node.

Induction Step : Given a previous state of breadth first search $B$, with the induction hypothesis holding. We seek to prove the next step of BFS mantains the hypothesis.  Consider a new node $n$ and edge $e$ being evaluted by BFS from the node $n_r$. By the lemma above, $n$ cannot be a cross edge ancestor nor descendant of $n_r$ as the edge distance between $g_r$ $n$ and $n_r$ $g_r$ would be different, contradicting the evalutation order of BFS.  This leaves with simpler picture.  Either $n_r$ is node that has been evaluted by BHS or not. If $n_r$ has already been evaluted by BHS, then it is a cross node, otherwise it is a tree node.  The lemma above prevents any other case, as backwards(forwards) nodes, on an undirected graph, contradict the edge distance order of BHS.

Give a linear algorithm to compute the chromatic number of graphs where each vertex has degree at most $2$.  Must such graphs be bipartite?

Use BFS traversal. If we come across any cross edges of any already discovered node we color the parent node with a color different than its the parent, and also different from the connected cross node. This situauion may never occure, in which case the graph is bipartite, otherwise this situation nessitates a third color.

A easy example that three colors may be required is a triangle.
<!-- 
Use a DFS traversal coloring child nodes differently than the parent.  If we run into a back edge we color the currently discovered child with a color different that the parent, and also different from the ancestor discovered through that back edge. -->

In breadth-first and depth-first search, an undiscovered node is marked *discovered* when it is first encountered, and marked *processed* when it has been completely searched.  At any given moment, several nodes might be simultaneously in the *discovered* state.

* ($a$) Describe a graph on $n$ vertices and a particular starting vertex $v$ such $\Theta(n)$ nodes are simultaneously in the *discovered* state during a *breadth-first* search starting from $v$.

* ($b$) Describe a graph on $n$ vertices and a particular starting vertex $v$ such that $\Theta(n)$ are simultaneously in the *discovered* state during a *depth-first search* starting from $v$.

* ($c$) Describe a graph on $n$ vertices and a particular starting vertex $v$ such that at some point $\Theta(n)$ nodes remain *undiscovered*, while $\Theta(n)$ nodes have been *processed* during a *depth-first search* starting from $v$. (Note, there may also be *discovered* nodes.)

($a$) Consider a tree with an edge height of one and $n-1$ children attached to the root node. Let $v$ be the root node. A singe step in BFS will recurse through every child of $v$, leaving $Î˜(n)$ nodes discovered.

($b$) Consider a tree where every node has only one child. Let $v$ be the root node.  Once DFS reaches the bottom of this tree every node will be on the stack and discovered.

($c$)  Consider a tree where of node height $n/2$. Let $v$ be the root node. with two nodes attached to it, and every other parent node only having one child.  We could think of this as a bifurcated linked list.  Afte the first iteartion of DFS resovle,s all the nodes on once side will be processed, while half the nodes on the other side will be undiscovered.  Since $\Theta(n/2) = \Theta(n)$, and our tree is $n/2$ node height tall, or discovered and processed nodes are both $\Theta(n)$.

Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, is it possible to reconstruct the tree? Is so, sketch an algorithm to do it.  If not give a counterexample. Repeat the problem if you are given the pre-order and post-order traversals.
We are give two lists representing the nodes as they were traversed.  In the first case with pre-order $A_p$ and in-order  $A_i$ traversal lists, a tree reconstruction is possible.  The first element of the pre-order list will be the root node $A_p[0] = n_r$.  We can then iterate the in-order list until we find $n_r$.  Once we find that node we know $A[0, ... \ (\text{index\_of}(n_r) - 1)]$ must be to the left of $n_r$.  Recursively we can look at $A_p[1]$ which will correspond to the left node at node level $1$. (Note * we are presuming every traversal computes left before right!).  This should split $A[0, ... \ (\text{index\_of}(A_p[1]) - 1)]$ into nodes that are leftwards of $A_p[1]$.  At this point we should be confident of this process.  In other words for each item in $A_p$ we split elements in $A_i$ until a split has one node in which case the node is a leaf node.

For the second case we are give pre-order and post-order traversal lists.  We cannot determine some cases.  For example we cannot resolve leftness or rightness of $B$ on the tree $A$, left child $B$, vs $A$ right child, $B$.  The pre-order list looks like $[A,B]$ and post-order $[B, A]$ for both lists.

The key take away is that in-order traversal preserves leftness vs rightness information which is absent in both pre and post traversal.

Present correct and effcient algorithms to convert an undirected graph $G$ between the following graph data structures.  You must give the the time complexity of each algorithm, assuming $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.

($a$) Convert from an adjacency matrix to adjacency lists.

($b$) Convert from an adjacency list to an incidence matrix.  An incidence matrix $M$ has a row for each vertex and a column from each edge, such that $M[i, j] = 1$ if vertex $i$ is part of edge $j$, otherwise $M[i,j]=0$.

($c$) Convert from an incidence matrix to adjacency lists.

($a$) To convert from an adjacency matrix to adjacency list, we will need to scan each vertex row for every connection.  Unfortunately there is no other way to find every edge in an adjacency matrix.  For every cell that constitutes a valid edge, we create and append a item to the linked list corresponding to the row we are on. This algorithm is $O(n^2)$, and we cannot do any better.

($b$) To convert from an adjacency list to an incidence matrix, we first allocate a $2D$ array of $e \times v$, where $e$ is the number of edges and $v$ is the number of vertices. Then we traverse every vertex linked list, using the edge struct to write in every edge column.  We could use a jump table or an index for every vertex, to write the other related vertex in constant time.  This algorithm is $O(e)$, or $O(en)$ if we include the allocation of the $2D$ array.

($c$) To convert from an incidence matrix to an adjacency list we scan a column for every *edge*. Using a jump table we choose the first vert we ran into and append the edge to that vert's linked list, in constant time.  This algorithm is $O(en)$ and optimal in terms of $O$ notation, as there is a necessity to evaluate every cell (- a vert row, still $O(n)$, in the worse case, in order to determine what a connection actually is.

What is interesting is when $e << n$.

Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a tree.  Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of the standard arithmetical operators (+, -, * /). For the expression $2 + 3 *4 + (3 * 4) / 5$ is represented by the tree in Figure 5.17($a$). Give an $O(n)$ algorithm for evaluating such an expression, where there are $n$ nodes in the tree.

Consider a DFS, post process traversal. That way if we are given a valid tree, then every node with children will have each child resolved to a number by the time we process that node.  Since this traversal traverses over every node, this algorithm is $O(n)$.


**5.10**
Suppose an arithmetic expression is give as a DAG (directed acyclic graph) with common subexpressions removed. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of the standard arithmetical operations (+, -, *, /). For example, the expression $2 + 3 âˆ— 4 + (3 âˆ— 4)/5$ is represented by the DAG in Figure 5.17($b$). Give an $O(n + m)$ algorithm for evaluating such a DAG, where there are $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in the DAG. Hint: modify an algorithm for the tree case to achieve the desired efficiency.

Consider a DFS traversal of DAG graph.  We store the list of already explored nodes, as well as $E$ an array of numbers, with one number per node.  Since each leaf node is an integer, for an arbituary starting node we use a post process DFS traversal to write the evaluated number for every node to $E$.  We then pick another unvisted node, and traverse checking if a node we visted already has a value.  The guarante of this algorithm is that every visted node will have a corresponding computed number, at the end of a traversal step.  This guarante allows us to classify the algorithm as $O(n + m)$(just like a DFS graph traversal, with some added baggage).

**5.11**

The war story of Section **5.4** (page **158**) describes an algorithm for constructing the dual graph of the triangulation effciently, although it does not guarantee linear time.  Give a worst-case linear algorithm for the problem.

Create a adjacency data structure where every item in the array is a triangle edge(a pair of two indices).  Then in each array we store a linked list of the indices of triangles that have a matching edge. The first step is constructing an array from triangle edges.  There are a few ways to do this as we need every pair of indices to map in constant time to a position in an array bounded by the number unique edges of the triangles (max size equal to 3 * count of triangles). The options are using a hashtable, an $O(n^2)$ 2 dimensional array, or by a pre pass with $O(n)$ counters.
Next we pass over the triangles accessing the head of the linked list for each edge in constant time and append the triangle to the end of the linked list.  This is our desired data structure.

So in total we pass over the data twice, the first time constructing an constant time access edge structure, and then using this structure to build the desired adjacency list.  This algorithm has an $O(n)$, because in the worst case where every triangle is isolated, we have at most 3 edges per triangle.

The counter setup looks like this, using a counting sort like rountine where the number of vertices is the upperbound.  Construct an array of linked lists for every vert with a structure that contains the triangle index and other edge index.  Populate the structure in $O(n)$ by a first pass.  Next for every linked list use an in place vetrex size array and a counter and write to a triangle sized array so that every triangle edge has an index to jump to on the final pass.   Essentialy we are performing several count sort type passes. This is more convoluted than any of the either methods, but requires less than $O(n^2)$ space which would take $O(n^2)$ running time to allocate.  The hashing method deals in atomized time, so this method is the only pure $O(n)$ of the three.

In practice I would always use hashing for this problem, unless I hit a point where even that was insufficent.
