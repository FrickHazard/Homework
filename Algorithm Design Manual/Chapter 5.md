Prove by induction that there is a unique path between any pair of vertices in a tree.



Inducting On : The *edge* height of a tree.

Hypothesis : For every node in the tree there is a unique path between any two nodes.

Base Case : Consider a tree of height 1 (edge height). This tree has a single root node and $k$ children nodes.  By the definition of a tree there is a unique edge for every child and parent. Consider two cases, either a pair of nodes is between the root node and and a child, or it is between two children.  In the first case the uniqueness of the path comes right from the tree definition.  In the second case a unique path between sibling nodes must go through the root. And since there there is a unique edge between a child and the root, and a path between two children is the combination of these, every pair of sibling nodes must have a uniqe path.

Induction Step : Given a tree $T_n$ were every two nodes have a unique path, we wish to show a tree $T_{n+1}$ has the same property. Since the path between nodes in $T_n$ are already guaranteed to be unique by the induction hypothesis, we are only concerned with paths involving the newly added leaf nodes of $T_{n+1}$.  For a pair of nodes $(n_i, n_j)$, one of which is a new leaf node of $T_{n+1}$, consider the following cases.  Case 1, the pair consists of a node in $T_n$ and a leaf node.  Case 2 both nodes are leaf nodes.  We wish to show that for both cases the invariance holds.  Case 1, suppose $n_i$ is the leaf node and $n_j$ the node in $T_n$. The path for the pair $(parent (n_i), n_j)$ is guaranteed to be unique.  Since this path is unique and adding an child edge to this path which is guarenteed to be unique by the one edge per child property of trees, the path between $(n_i, n_j)$ must then be unique.  Case 2, consider the path between $(parent (n_i), parent(n_j))$.  This path must be unique by the induction hypothesis. Again since every edge between a parent and a child is unique in trees, adding the edge between $(n_i, parent (n_i))$ and $(n_j, parent (n_j))$ must be unique to $n_i$ and $n_j$ respectively.  Thus $T_{n+1}$ has a unique path between any two nodes.

Prove that in breadth first search on a undirected graph $G$ every edge is either a tree or a cross edge, where $x$ is neither an ancestor nor descendant of $y$, in cross edge $(x, y)$.

Consider a breadth first search on a graph $G$ starting at a node $g_r$.


<!-- On an undirected graph, backwards edges (forward edges) with respect to $g_r$ cannot exist in a breadth first search.  This can be seen by considering the fact that in a breadth first search we evalute edges with distance $d_1$ to $g_r$ before edges of greater distance $d_2 > d_1$.  For an undirected graph finding a backward(forward) edge would be contradiction, as the distance between a backward(forward) edge and $g_r$ would be less than the distance between $g_r$ and the edge that discovered the backward(forward) edge, contradicting the distance property of BHS. -->

**Lemma**

In a breadth first search we evalute edges with distance $d_1$ to $g_r$ before edges of greater distance $d_2 > d_1$.  For an undirected graph finding a node $n$ with an edge distance shorter than the its parent search node $n_r$ would be contradiction, as the distance between a $n$ and $g_r$ would be less than the distance between $n_r$ and $g_r$. This contradicts the distance property of BHS.

**Induction**

Inducting On : A step of breadth first search.  Where a step is the evaluation all the nodes of edge distance $d$ away from $g_r$.

Induction Hypothesis : Every edge is a tree edge or a cross edge $(x, y)$ such that $x$ is neither an ancestor nor descendant of $y$, in cross edge $(x, y)$

Base case : The first evalution of connected nodes of $G_r$.  Since we every node were are evaluting is a direct descedant of $G_r$, every node must be a tree node.

Induction Step : Given a previous state of breadth first search $B$, with the induction hypothesis holding. We seek to prove the next step of BFS mantains the hypothesis.  Consider a new node $n$ and edge $e$ being evaluted by BFS from the node $n_r$. By the lemma above, $n$ cannot be a cross edge ancestor nor descendant of $n_r$ as the edge distance between $g_r$ $n$ and $n_r$ $g_r$ would be different, contradicting the evalutation order of BFS.  This leaves with simpler picture.  Either $n_r$ is node that has been evaluted by BHS or not. If $n_r$ has already been evaluted by BHS, then it is a cross node, otherwise it is a tree node.  The lemma above prevents any other case, as backwards(forwards) nodes, on an undirected graph, contradict the edge distance order of BHS.

Give a linear algorithm to compute the chromatic number of graphs where each vertex has degree at most $2$.  Must such graphs be bipartite?

Use BFS traversal. If we come across any cross edges of any already discovered node we color the parent node with a color different than its the parent, and also different from the connected cross node. This situauion may never occure, in which case the graph is bipartite, otherwise this situation nessitates a third color.

A easy example that three colors may be required is a triangle.
<!-- 
Use a DFS traversal coloring child nodes differently than the parent.  If we run into a back edge we color the currently discovered child with a color different that the parent, and also different from the ancestor discovered through that back edge. -->

In breadth-first and depth-first search, an undiscovered node is marked *discovered* when it is first encountered, and marked *processed* when it has been completely searched.  At any given moment, several nodes might be simultaneously in the *discovered* state.

* ($a$) Describe a graph on $n$ vertices and a particular starting vertex $v$ such $\Theta(n)$ nodes are simultaneously in the *discovered* state during a *breadth-first* search starting from $v$.

* ($b$) Describe a graph on $n$ vertices and a particular starting vertex $v$ such that $\Theta(n)$ are simultaneously in the *discovered* state during a *depth-first search* starting from $v$.

* ($c$) Describe a graph on $n$ vertices and a particular starting vertex $v$ such that at some point $\Theta(n)$ nodes remain *undiscovered*, while $\Theta(n)$ nodes have been *processed* during a *depth-first search* starting from $v$. (Note, there may also be *discovered* nodes.)

($a$) Consider a tree with an edge height of one and $n-1$ children attached to the root node. Let $v$ be the root node. A singe step in BFS will recurse through every child of $v$, leaving $Î˜(n)$ nodes discovered.

($b$) Consider a tree where every node has only one child. Let $v$ be the root node.  Once DFS reaches the bottom of this tree every node will be on the stack and discovered.

($c$)  Consider a tree where of node height $n/2$. Let $v$ be the root node. with two nodes attached to it, and every other parent node only having one child.  We could think of this as a bifurcated linked list.  Afte the first iteartion of DFS resovle,s all the nodes on once side will be processed, while half the nodes on the other side will be undiscovered.  Since $\Theta(n/2) = \Theta(n)$, and our tree is $n/2$ node height tall, or discovered and processed nodes are both $\Theta(n)$.
