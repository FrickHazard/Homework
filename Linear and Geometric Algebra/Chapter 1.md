**Definition 1.1** Oriented Length. An *Orientated length* **v** is an oriented segment of a line.  The length of **v** is called the *norm* it is denotated |**v**|.

**Excercise 1.1.** Which oriented lengths below lie on parallel lines?

{ A, C, F } {B} {D} {E} {G}

**Excercise 1.2.** Which oriented lengths below have the same norm?

{ A, E, H I } {B} {C} { D, F, G }

**Excercise 1.3.** Suppose that the oriented length $\bold{v}$ represents a displacement of 20km to the northeast describe the displacements represented by $2\bold{v}$ and $(-\frac{1}{2})\bold{v}$.

The displacement $2\bold{v}$ represents twice the distance in the same direction, i.e. 40km north east.  The displacement of $(-\frac{1}{2})\bold{v}$ represents half the distance in the oppisite direction.

**Excercise 1.4.** Using $\bold{v}$ and $\bold{w}$ from Figure 1.10, draw a diagram showing that $2(\bold{v} + \bold{w}) = 2\bold{v} + 2\bold{w}$. The general rule is that $a(\bold{v} + \bold{w}) = a\bold{v} + a\bold{w}$ for every $a$, $\bold{v}$ and $\bold{w}$.  We say that scalar multiplication *distributes* over vector addition.
