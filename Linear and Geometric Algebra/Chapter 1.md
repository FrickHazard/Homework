**Definition 1.1** Oriented Length. An *Orientated length* **v** is an oriented segment of a line.  The length of **v** is called the *norm* it is denotated |**v**|.

**Excercise 1.1.** Which oriented lengths below lie on parallel lines?

{ A, C, F } {B} {D} {E} {G}

**Excercise 1.2.** Which oriented lengths below have the same norm?

{ A, E, H I } {B} {C} { D, F, G }

**Excercise 1.3.** Suppose that the oriented length $\bold{v}$ represents a displacement of 20km to the northeast describe the displacements represented by $2\bold{v}$ and $(-\frac{1}{2})\bold{v}$.

The displacement $2\bold{v}$ represents twice the distance in the same direction, i.e. 40km north east.  The displacement of $(-\frac{1}{2})\bold{v}$ represents half the distance in the oppisite direction.

**Excercise 1.4.** Using $\bold{v}$ and $\bold{w}$ from Figure 1.10, draw a diagram showing that $2(\bold{v} + \bold{w}) = 2\bold{v} + 2\bold{w}$. The general rule is that $a(\bold{v} + \bold{w}) = a\bold{v} + a\bold{w}$ for every $a$, $\bold{v}$ and $\bold{w}$.  We say that scalar multiplication *distributes* over vector addition.

**Excercise 1.5.** Consider two orientated lengths $\bold{v_1}$ and $\bold{v_2}$ tail to tail. (Neither is a scalar multiple of the other.) Show that every orientated length $\bold{v}$ in the plane determined by $\bold{v_1}$ and $\bold{v_2}$ is of the form $t_1\bold{v_1} + t_2\bold{v_2}$ for some scalars $t_1$ and $t_2$.

This is by definition, no seriously this is the only valid answer to this question.

**Excercise 1.6.** Let $\bold{v_1}$ and $\bold{v_2}$ be given orientated lengths.  Show that not every orientated length in three dimensions can be written in the form $t_1\bold{v_1} + t_2\bold{v_2}$

Consider two cases, either $\bold{v_1}$ and $\bold{v_2}$ form a line if they are linearly dependant or they form a plane.  Since a plane does not cover all of 3d space we know that there must exist points outside of this equations reach.  In fact we may find a vector which is not a scalar multiple of either.  This would be the cross product
