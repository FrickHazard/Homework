Suppose that $f$ is a real function defined on $\R^1$ which satisfies

$$\lim_{h \to 0} [f(x + h) - f (x-h)] = 0$$

for every $x \in \R^1$. Doe this imply that $f$ is continuous.

For every $\epsilon > 0$,

There exists a $\delta > 0 \implies |(x + h - x - h) - (x - x)| < \delta \implies |f(x + h) - f(x - h)| < \epsilon$






(∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ →  |f x - f x₀| ≤ ε) ↔
(∃ ε > 0, ∀ δ > 0, ∃ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ ∧ |f x - f x₀| > ε )
